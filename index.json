Documentation 📝 Refer to the Scripting Reference Installing 📦 ⚠️ OpenUPM doesn't have up to date releases. Install using NPM registry instead 👇 Ensure you have the NPM registry in the packages.json file of your Unity project with com.adrenak.unimic as one of the scopes \"scopedRegistries\": [ { \"name\": \"npmjs\", \"url\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org\", \"scopes\": [ \"com.npmjs\", \"com.adrenak.unimic\" ] } } Add \"com.adrenak.unimic\" : \"x.y.z\" to dependencies list in packages.json file where x.y.z is the version name 💬 You can see the versions on the NPM page here . Also note that v3.x.x is recommended. v3 has several breaking changes against v1 and v2. Refer to the scripting reference if you're upgrading. Samples 🚀 Getting started with some samples is the best way to see the features of UniMic, and there are many! Ensure that atleast one recording device is connected to your PC/Mac for the samples to work. Simple MicAudioSource Sample A gameobject called My Mic is placed. It has the MicAudioSource component. Another gmeobject called Sample has SimpleMicAudioSourceSample On start it checks if there are any mic devices available If yes, it takes the first recording device available and starts the recording using .StartRecording() Then assigns the device to MicAudioSource , which then starts playing the audio Play the scene. You should be able to hear your voice in the editor Multiple MicAudioSource Sample Run the scene, you should see every mic device connected On start, all the devices will start recording in parallel and playing back Toggling the checkbox on or off will start or stop the recording for a device Prefab MicDeviceCell is used to represent one device. The MicDeviceCell.cs script handles its UI. Check out the MultipleMicAudioSourceSample script to see how the UI has been created MicAudioSource Switch Sample Run the scene, recording should start on one device and a dropdown will show all the available recording devices Use the dropdown to change to a difference device at runtime Check out the MicAudioSourceSwitchSample script to see how the Device of a MicAudioSource can be changed at runtime. Spatial Blend Sample (for spatial audio) Run the scene, the audio source is a moving ball. When you speak, your audio is played from the balls position. Use headphones to hear the sound moving. Using the slider, you can change the spatial blend from 0 to 1 Note 📄 Some Xiaomi phones may prevent side loaded APKs from functioning. There is no AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancelletion). If you're trying the samples be sure to use headphones to avoid creating a feedback loop. Contact 👥 @github @website @discord: adrenak#1934"
