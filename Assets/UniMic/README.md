## UniMic 🎤
A wrapper for Unity's Microphone class.  
Provides easy APIs for mic input and management.  
Also includes `StreamedAudioSource`, a (not Microphone related) class that can be used for playing streaming audio by feeding it incoming audio samples.

        ]
    }

Add `"com.adrenak.unimic" : "x.y.z"` to `dependencies` list in `packages.json` file where `x.y.z` is the version name
> 💬 You can see the versions on the NPM page [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/com.adrenak.unimic?activeTab=versions).  
> Also note that v3.x.x is recommended. v3 has several breaking changes against v1 and v2. Refer to the scripting reference if you're upgrading.  

## Samples 🚀
Getting started with some samples is the best way to see the features of UniMic, and there are many!

Ensure that atleast one recording device is connected to your PC/Mac for the samples to work.

### Simple MicAudioSource Sample
- A gameobject called `My Mic` is placed. It has the `MicAudioSource` component. 
- Another gmeobject called `Sample` has `SimpleMicAudioSourceSample`
    - On start it checks if there are any mic devices available
    - If yes, it takes the first recording device available and starts the recording using `.StartRecording()`
    - Then assigns the device to `MicAudioSource`, which then starts playing the audio
- Play the scene. You should be able to hear your voice in the editor

### Multiple MicAudioSource Sample
- Run the scene, you should see every mic device connected 
    - On start, all the devices will start recording in parallel and playing back
    - Toggling the checkbox on or off will start or stop the recording for a device
- Prefab `MicDeviceCell` is used to represent one device. The `MicDeviceCell.cs` script handles its UI.
- Check out the `MultipleMicAudioSourceSample` script to see how the UI has been created

### MicAudioSource Switch Sample
- Run the scene, recording should start on one device and a dropdown will show all the available recording devices
- Use the dropdown to change to a difference device at runtime
- Check out the `MicAudioSourceSwitchSample` script to see how the Device of a `MicAudioSource` can be changed at runtime.

### Spatial Blend Sample (for spatial audio)
- Run the scene, the audio source is a moving ball.
- When you speak, your audio is played from the balls position. Use headphones to hear the sound moving.
- Using the slider, you can change the spatial blend from 0 to 1

## Note 📄
* Some Xiaomi phones may prevent side loaded APKs from functioning.  
* There is no AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancelletion). If you're trying the samples be sure to use headphones to avoid creating a feedback loop.
